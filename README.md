This repository contains SQL queries and supporting scripts for an Airline Database Capstone project. The project is aimed at solving various real-world problems using SQL queries such as seat allocation, flight schedules, and passenger details.

📝 Project Overview
The airline database project was part of a capstone course. The goal was to write SQL queries to solve business-related problems, such as retrieving booking details, identifying top-paying customers, and more.

Key Features
🛠️ SQL queries for different business use cases:

📄 Booking and passenger data extraction
💺 Identifying seat allocations
🏆 Reporting on monthly highest-paying passengers
📅 Flight schedules and travel details
🛫 Airport and aircraft details
📚 Documentation for each query can be found in the docs/ folder

💡 Queries
Each query solves a specific problem statement from the airline database. Here are a few examples:

Query 1: Represent the book_date column in yyyy-mmm-dd format from the Bookings table.
Query 2: Get the following columns: ticket_no, boarding_no, seat_number, passenger_id, passenger_name.
Query 3: Find the seat number which is least allocated among all seats.
